Android ported JStock, initially initiated by me, Cheok, is not maintained anymore and can be considered as deprecated. It is currently hosted in Bitbucket private repo as a closed source project.

The end product itself can be downloaded from https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.yccheok.jstock.gui
